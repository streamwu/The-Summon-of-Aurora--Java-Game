** The summon of aurora **

there are three levels.
1st. the Array of Asteroid （陨石之阵）
2nd. the Visit of ET  (外星来客)
3rd. the Final Fight of peace   (和平之役)

Initially, you have 
* five falcons.
* three opportunities for shield. (press A to generate a circle to protect you)
* three opportunities for hyperspace (press D to take you to a safe position instantly)

When the game begins, you will have two special props（in blue color） to collect
* newShipFloater.
  Used for power-up. Flip it, and you'll gain one more falcon
* CruiseFloater. 
  Used for collect cruise. Flip it, and you'll gain a cruise.
  When using it, just press F. 
  And the cruise will trace a certain foe(randomly selected) and kill it.
  (if the foe is killed by the falcon before by it, the cruise will select a new object   and kill it.)

Here are the differences between distinct levels:
* The higher the level is, the larger velocity the falcon has.
* The higher the level is, the higher frequency for newShipFloaters and CruiseFloaters to   emerge
* UFOs begin to emerge in level2. 
  In level2, there are five self-service UFOs to come to earth to scout. 
  In level3, there are seven ones. But this time, there are aliens inside them, and they will shoot destructive bullets. You have to escape from them and kill the UFOs.


Finally, if you complete all the missions, congratulations! 
And you are honored for bringing the earth back to peace!
